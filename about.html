          <p class="text-muted">As a child, games occupied most of my time, from GBA (Game Boy Advance) portable game at that time to current video games. I have experienced many different games, and the existence of each different game has opened up different worlds for me and immersed me there. These games tell stories one after the other and are exciting and open my horizons. Since then, a large part of me will develop into the game.

          <p class="text-muted">For beginners who have just stepped into digital art, all the related techniques and skills are new and unknown. I am willing to try to use them in each different technology and different media fields, because this will allow me to understand further and become familiar with digital media, and also allow me to be more sophisticated in my abilities. Although I have many ideas, how to present them is based on my skills. Therefore, I have practiced 2D vision, 3D modeling, web design, coding, and other essential technologies, but still, need different knowledge and exercises to achieve a sufficient degree of freedom. Therefore, I also need to improve my essential ability to satisfy and enhance my creativity. I try various types of works, and whether they can express my ideas to a certain extent. In the form of code, pictures, and electronic media, it is wholly presented in front of the computer screen. I am improving, and I am continually improving these works, and I will continue to retain and extend the content to develop these stories.
