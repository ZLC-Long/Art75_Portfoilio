      <h4><i>Glitch Art</i>, 2020</h4>
<br>
<p class="description">For my glitch art, I chose the deer picture because I thought that animal can more present the relationship between animals and technology. I was using the audacity and jpg to txt to create my works. I opened the picture first, then converted the format to txt, and watched the change of the picture by copying the data and saving and undoing the action until I was satisfied. Then the second one uses audacity to change the picture, and the rendering effects are invert, echo and normalize. The middle part is invert, the top is echo, and the bottom is normalize. I have tried many different effects, but the work presented now is more satisfactory to me. I prefer the first processed picture because its changes can be seen as a vertical change like a staircase. All in all, the whole mission opened up a new horizon for me and allowed me to see the unique visual presentation of glitch art, which was fun.
